Script to change clothes at work places

This script was a request by some of our players to be able to change / remove their clothes at the work place. It's a script built for a portuguese community, 
so it doesnt have a english translation. It needs the basic ESX (skin / skinchanger) and also uses mythic_notify for notifications.



## Requirements
- es_extended
- skinchanger
- skin 
- mythic_notify

```
start rl_trocarroupa
```
